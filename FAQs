                    <p>The first step is to get admission to a Canadian Designated Learning Institution (DLI) recognized by the government of Canada. Once an individual receives a letter of acceptance from a DLI, he or she may be eligible to apply for a
                        study permit. Applications may be made online or by mail. All new study permits are issued at a Canadian port of entry. An applicant who has applied to a foreign Canadian Visa Office will be issued a letter of approval advising
                        him or her to travel to a Canadian port of entry to have the study permit issued. A study permit is generally issued for the duration of the person’s studies. </p>

                    <p>You can apply for your PGWP once you have completed, the requirement of your program, and received a notification of your eligibility to graduate. This can be proved with a transcript or an official letter. At the time of application,
                        a candidate must hold a valid study permit. Additionally, the application must be submitted within 90 days of receiving written confirmation that the candidate has completed his or her studies. </p>

                    <p>A study or work permit is not a visa and doesn't allow you to enter Canada. If your TRV or eTA is still valid, and your study permit has not expired you may be able to return to Canada. If your TRV or eTA has expired, you will need
                        to apply for a new one. If your application for a PGWP was approved during your time outside of Canada, you may enter the country as a worker. A border officer may ask for proof that you applied for a PGWP when you return to the
                        country. For example, a copy of your application, the fee payment receipt, etc. </p>

                <div class="acc-header">What is Express Entry?</div>
                <div class="acc-text">
                    <p>Express Entry is an electronic management application system for immigration to Canada. It is not an immigration program. Rather, it facilitates the selection and processing of Canada’s economic immigration programs:

                <div class="acc-text">
                    <p>If this happens, it is known as misrepresentation and, depending on the nature and severity of the false claim, carries penalties. A potential candidate who has been found to have provided false information going into the Express Entry
                        pool can be banned from re-entering the pool for five years. Therefore, it is hugely important to provide accurate and correct information always. Candidates who are unsure about how to assess their own abilities and credentials
                        may want to seek advice from a Regulated Immigration Consultant or an immigration lawyer before entering the Express Entry pool. </p>

                    <p>Candidates who receive an invitation to apply for permanent residence from a Canadian province or territory should have the intention to reside in that particular province or territory. The Provincial Nominee Programs (PNPs) are set
                        up to address local and regional labour market needs, and so it follows that candidates invited to apply through a PNP are deemed likely to succeed in that particular province or territory. Once a candidate has landed in Canada,
                        however, he or she will have the right to freedom of movement within Canada, as well as the right to live and work anywhere in Canada for any employer.
